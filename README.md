How to play the game:

You are the white square, with P written on it. Your target is to "touch" the moving yellow square,
which can pass through the vertical walls. You will be hindered in your task by the spawning red squares,
which make movement through them impossible. You can however remove the red squares by using your bomb, in
exchange for a score penalty.

The bomb removes all the red squares in the 3x3 square with you at the center.

The score is negative. The magnitude increases with time, as well as the more you use bombs.
